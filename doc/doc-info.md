# Documentation boost.brick

Add at least following:

- Schematic pdf
- Layout assembly drawing top and bottom
- Bill of Materials

## Remarks

Try to use formats that are rendered by Github/Gitlab so people do not have to download/clone to view documentation.

PDF documents and other generated files in repository's are not optimal. As long as there is now good way to generate this documentation with CI/CD pipelines, it is better to manually generate pdfs and put them into this folder. Try the best to keep it up to date.
